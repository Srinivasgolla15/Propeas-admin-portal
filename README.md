importance of each file :

‚úÖ Root-Level Files
File Name	Purpose & Importance
index.tsx	Entry point of the React app. This is where the app is mounted to the DOM. Without this, the app will not start.
App.tsx	Root component that defines the main structure and routes of the app. All other pages and components are loaded from here.
index.html	HTML shell that contains the root <div id="root">. React injects the app here. Without it, nothing will render in the browser.
package.json	Contains metadata about the project and dependencies. Vital for running, installing, and building the project.
tsconfig.json	TypeScript configuration. Controls how TypeScript compiles your code. Missing this will break type-checking and development experience.
vite.config.ts	Configuration file for Vite (a fast build tool). Defines how the project should be served and built. Needed for dev server and production build.
.env.local	Stores environment variables (e.g. API keys). Useful for sensitive configuration. Missing this might break features relying on these values.
.gitignore	Tells Git which files/folders to ignore (like node_modules). Keeps repo clean. Missing this may cause clutter or security issues.
