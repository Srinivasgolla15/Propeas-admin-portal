/* Using Tailwind's @tailwind directives in a CSS file is standard practice for including base, components, and utilities.
   However, for this CDN-only setup, Tailwind is loaded via <script> in index.html.
   This file can be kept minimal or used for very specific global overrides not easily achievable with Tailwind utility classes.
   For this exercise, we'll assume Tailwind loaded via CDN handles base styles correctly.
   If you were using a build process (e.g., Vite, Create React App with PostCSS), you'd have:
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

html {
  font-size: 106.25%; /* Approx 17px if browser default is 16px. This makes 1rem = 17px. */

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  /* Tailwind's bg-background and text-foreground should handle this,
     but as a fallback or for non-Tailwind-styled root elements */
